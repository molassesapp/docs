# React JavaScript Sdk

the React (with TypeScript support) SDK for Molasses. It allows you to evaluate user's status for a feature. It also helps simplify logging events for A/B testing.

`react-molasses` offers a provider with hooks and `with` support. Once initialized, it takes microseconds to evaluate if a user is active. `react-molasses` does rely on `molasses-js` as a client.

## Install

`npm install @molassesapp/molasses-js react-molasses`

`yarn add @molassesapp/molasses-js react-molasses`

## Usage

To Require:

```js
import { MolassesClient } from "@molassesapp/molasses-js";
import { MolassesProvider } from "react-molasses";
```

Initialize the same way you would with `molasses-js`, but wrap your main application in the `MolassesProvider`

```js
// Initialize with your API Key
const client = new MolassesClient({
  APIKey: "testapikey",
});

// Then init which is a promise
client.init().then(() => {
  const AppContainer = () => {
    return (
      <MolassesProvider client={client}>
        <Router>
          <App />
        </Router>
      </MolassesProvider>
    );
  };

  ReactDOM.render(<AppContainer />, document.getElementById("root"));
});
```

Once it's initialized, you can then use Molasses in any component using React's context api. We've created a set of hooks and components to make this easier for you.

## Components and Hooks

### MolassesProvider

`<MolassesProvider client={client}>`

Wraps any children and provides the `MolassesClient` in the `React.context`. Molasses must be initialized before it can be used.

#### Props

| Prop   | required | type             | description                                                   |
| ------ | -------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| client | required | `MolassesClient` | the initialized MolassesClient to pass into the react context |

### Feature

`<Feature name="NAME" user={user}>`

A component to evaluate a Feature by name. It can be used in several different ways, declarative using children, function based and using the `render` prop.

#### Props

| Prop   | required | type                     | description                                          |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| name   | required | `string`                 | The name of the feature to be evaluated              |
| user   | optional | `User`                   | The user who to evaluate against                     |
| render | optional | `Function | JSX.Element` | What to render based on the result of the evaluation |
| render | optional | `Function | JSX.Element` | What to render based on the result of the evaluation |

#### Examples

```jsx
const Component = (props) => (
  <Feature name="NEW_CHECKOUT" user={user}>
    <div>I'll render if NEW_CHECKOUT is active for that user</div>
  </Feature>
);

const ComponentB = (props) => (
  <Feature
    name="NEW_CHECKOUT"
    user={user}
    render={(isActive: boolean) => {
      return isActive ? (
        <span>I'll render if I'm active</span>
      ) : (
        <span>I won't</span>
      );
    }}
  />
);

const ComponentC = (props) => (
  <Feature name="NEW_CHECKOUT" user={user}>
    {(isActive: boolean) => {
      return isActive ? (
        <span>I'll render if I'm active</span>
      ) : (
        <span>I won't</span>
      );
    }}
  </Feature>
);
```

### useFeature

`useFeature(name: string, user: User): boolean`

A hook to determine if a given feature is active for a `User`. Uses the Molasses context under the hood

### useMolasses

`useMolasses(): MolassesClient`

A hook to expose the Molasses client to a component

### withMolasses

`withMolasses(Component: React Component)`

A HOC that passes the `MolassesClient` as the prop `molasses` to the component

#### Example

```jsx
const comp = (props) => {
  const isActive = props.molasses.isActive("FOO_TEST");
  return isActive ? <h1>active</h1> : <h1>off</h1>;
};
const Component = withMolasses(comp);
```
