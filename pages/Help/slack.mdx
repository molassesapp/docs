# Slack Integration

You can integrate Molasses to provide updates to your team's Slack.

Start by going to the _Settings_ section of Molasses and clicking the _Add to Slack_ button.

You'll be prompted to add Molasses to your Slack environment and choose the channel to receive updates.

After they are connected, your Slack will receive events like Feature Flag Updated, Feature Flag Created etc.
