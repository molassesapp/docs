# Molasses' Architecture

Molasses is built to be fast for your workloads. When you modify a feature flag, the feature flag delivery service is updated with the latest changes.

The Node and Golang clients use SSE to get updates pushed directly to them. While other clients use polling. After initialization, the features are populated in the client and there is no reason to fear a blocking call.
