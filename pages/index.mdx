# Getting Started

Welcome to Molasses! I built Molasses so that every team can have the tools to perform safe and frequent deployments.

Molasses is built to make development easy, but also be fast. [Learn more about Molasses' architecture](/architecture)

It takes just a few minutes to get started with Molasses:

When you sign up for Molasses, the app guides you through setting up your environments, API Keys, and your first feature flag. but here's the steps to get started:

- **Install** Install the Molasses SDK package for your project. eg `npm install --save @molassesapp/molasses-server`
- **Configure** Make sure your [environment](/environments), it's API Key, and the features you need are configured. You can configure Molasses to do simple toggles or complex A/B tests. [Learn more >](/features)
- **Setup** Copy the feature name and the API key, use their values to initiate a connection with Molasses.
- **Code** Write your new feature and wrap it with one of Molasses' evaluation tools. For example:

```js
if (client.isActive("NEW_CHECKOUT")) {
  // do the new thing
} else {
  // do the normal thing
}
```

- **Collect Feedback** (Optionally) collect metrics about how it worked [learn more about experiments](/features)
